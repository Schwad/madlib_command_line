madlib_command_line
===================

Allows user to play a mad lib from the command line.


## Remember those mad libs?

I sure do. 4th grade, learning about nouns and adjectives and basic grammar. Listing out words and then writing them into a story, only to see a funny outcome!

This project seeks to create a command-line friendly ruby program to run your own mad libs! Want to add your own stories? Feel free to contribute!
